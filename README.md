Netflix Clone ðŸŽ¬
Overview:
This project is a Netflix Clone built using HTML and CSS. The main objective is to replicate the design and user interface of the popular streaming platform, allowing users to browse through movie and TV show categories with a clean, responsive layout. This project focuses purely on frontend development, using modern web design techniques to mimic the Netflix experience.

Features:
1. User Interface:
Landing Page: A sleek, modern design that resembles Netflixâ€™s home page with a featured movie/TV show at the top.
Movie Browsing: Categories like trending, popular, and recently added movies or shows are organized into visually appealing sections.
Hover Effects: When users hover over a movie or TV show thumbnail, additional details like the title, description, and a play button are shown.
Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

2. Video Sections:
Thumbnails: Display of movie/show thumbnails in grids and horizontal scrolling sections for easier browsing.
Featured Section: A hero section at the top of the page highlighting a selected movie/show with a large banner and description.

Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the web page and defining its content.
CSS3: For styling, layout, and responsiveness.
Use of Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout.
CSS animations and transitions for hover effects and smooth interactions.
Media queries for responsive design across different device sizes.
